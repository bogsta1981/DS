# Data Science and Big Data Postgraduate Course at UB

Data Science and Big Data
course offers students a program that covers the concepts and tools you will need throughout the entire data science pipeline: asking the right questions; wrangling and cleaning data; generating hypothesis; making inferences; visualizing data; assessing solutions; and building data products.

The program is specially designed for students with a background in computer science, mathematics, and applied statistics, but other scientific and engineering backgrounds can be considered.

We will require to follow lessons and complete class exercises using personal laptops. You will not be able to complete all your assignments in class if you rely solely on desktop equipment at home.
