Data Science and Big Data
course offers students a program that covers the concepts and tools you will need throughout the entire data science pipeline: asking the right questions; wrangling and cleaning data; generating hypothesis; making inferences; visualizing data; assessing solutions; and building data products.

Parts of the presented materials in the postgraduate course of Data Science and Big Data from Universitat de Barcelona have been used in the recently published "Introduction to Data Science: A Python Approach to Concepts, Techniques and Applications" book. This book is accompanied by a set of IPython Notebooks containing all the codes necessary to solve the practical cases of the book. The Notebooks can be found on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/DataScienceUB/introductiondatascience-python-book.
