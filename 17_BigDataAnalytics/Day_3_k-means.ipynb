    "**k-means clustering** is a method of _vector quantization_, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition _n_ observations into _k_ clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.\n",
