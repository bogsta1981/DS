$$ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H)P(H)}{P(E)}$$

Bayesian statistics interprets probabilities as measures of believability (how confident we are) in an event, not as the long-run frequency of events.

Beliefs mesaures are applied to individuals, not to nature, so there is room for conflicting belives among individuals. Different beliefs are not intepreted as errors but as different states of knowledge about an event. 

The formula is interpreted as an updating of belief after observing data.
